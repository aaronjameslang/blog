    "content": "Blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments in painting, drawing (art) and traditional colour theory, as well as in the RGB colour model. It lies between purple and green on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. An optical effect called Tyndall effect explains blue eyes. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective. Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times. The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in the Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all pigments. In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain. In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of cathedrals. Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America. In the 19th century, synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced organic dyes and mineral pigments. Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits. Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union. Surveys in the US and Europe show that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, faithfulness, confidence, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and occasionally with sadness. In US and European public opinion polls it is the most popular colour, chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour.[4] The same surveys also showed that blue was the colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black, and was also the colour most associated with intelligence, knowledge, calm and concentration.

    "title": "Green",
    "content": "Green is the color between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum. It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495–570 nm. In subtractive color systems, used in painting and color printing, it is created by a combination of yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, it is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll, the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy. Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage. Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content. During post-classical and early modern Europe, green was the color commonly associated with wealth, merchants, bankers and the gentry, while red was reserved for the nobility. For this reason, the costume of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci and the benches in the British House of Commons are green while those in the House of Lords are red. It also has a long historical tradition as the color of Ireland and of Gaelic culture. It is the historic color of Islam, representing the lush vegetation of Paradise. It was the color of the banner of Muhammad, and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries. In surveys made in American, European, and Islamic countries, green is the color most commonly associated with nature, life, health, youth, spring, hope, and envy. In the European Union and the United States, green is also sometimes associated with toxicity and poor health,[4] but in China and most of Asia, its associations are very positive, as the symbol of fertility and happiness.[3] Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the environmental movement. Political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the Green movement, some naming themselves Green parties. This has led to similar campaigns in advertising, as companies have sold green, or environmentally friendly, products. Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission; a green light means go ahead, a green card permits permanent residence in the United States. ",

    "content": "For a given exponential curve and a given line, can we know if and where they intersect? . That is, for two equations \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) \\[ y = mx + b \\] \\[ z = e^{nx} + c\\] can we solve \\(y = z\\), or even tell if there is a solution? \\[ mx + b = e^{nx} + c \\] . A better mathmatician than I might be able to solve that, but in the meantime let's graph an example. Below \\(y\\) intersects \\(z\\), but not \\(z'\\). Looking at this graph we can see that the exponential gradient starts shallow and ends up steep. And if the curves intersect, it must be at points where there gradients are unequal, else they'd be parralel. Assuming both curves have a positive gradient, at the first intersection the gradient of \\(z\\) must be less than that of \\(y\\), and vice versa at the second intersection. And as both curves are smooth, somewhere in between these intersections the gradients must be equal. Differentiating these functions we get \\[ {dy \\over dx} = m \\] \\[ {dz \\over dx} = ne^{nx}\\] and when equated we can easily solve for \\(x\\) \\[ ne^{nx} = m \\] \\[ e^{nx} = { m \\over n } \\] \\[ nx = \\ln { m \\over n } \\] \\[ nx = \\ln m - \\ln n \\] \\[ x = { \\ln m - \\ln n \\over n } \\] . So now we know that when \\( x = { \\ln m - \\ln n \\over n } \\) the lines are parallel, and if the lines intersect at all \\(z\\) must be less than \\(y\\) at this point. Once we know there the lines intersect, we can resort to numerical methods to find the intersection itself, such as a binary search or the Newton-Raphson method. ",

By the time you’ve saved up your deposit, it may no longer be enough to afford the house you want! . Just by glancing at the graph above we can see that house prices go up over the long term, but predicting even a few years ahead is difficult. Trends plotted in 1990 or 2007 would not have been accurate a few years later. Many finance trends are exponential, so let’s look at the above data on a logarithmic scale. Now the same data paints a different picture, if fact in you squint hard enough you can almost see a linear trend. Smoother data is easier to predict, and the 2008 financial crash does look a lot less pronounced from this perspective, appearing to be merely a reversion to the “expected” price. However the 1990s slump is still there, and new irregularities have even appeared, such as the boom in the early 1970s. An easing of credit conditions by the Bank of England coupled with the go-for-growth strategy of the Conservative chancellor, Tony Barber, resulted in house-price inflation peaking at 36%. The average price of a home, which had risen from £2,000 to £5,000 between 1950 and 1970, doubled in the next three years. The boom ended when the Yom Kippur war and the Opec oil embargo ushered in the stagflation of the mid-1970s. L. Elliot, A brief history of British housing .

It is a primary color in the RGB color model and a secondary color (made from magenta and yellow) in the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan. Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy. Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art. The Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories. It was also an important color in China, where it was used to color early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces. In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal. The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes, which replaced the traditional dyes. Red became a symbolic color of communism; Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, later followed by China, Vietnam, and other communist countries. Since red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger, and courage. Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love, and joy. In China, India and many other Asian countries it is the color symbolizing happiness and good fortune. ",
