    "title": "Explicit Versioning",
    "content": "Versioning is an important part of software development, but simply having a version number isn’t much use if your users can’t access it. In almost every piece of software you’ve installed there’ll be an “About” menu with details on which version of the software you have. Debugging issues if far easier if you know which version of your software has the bug. Visible version information is also important (although less common) for software presented as a service, such as a web application. Both web sites and APIs benefit from user-facing versioning, whether it’s during internal testing or in production. Sometimes, knowing when an issue occured can narrow down the version that caused it. This isn’t a robust solution however, espicially if the bug report doesn’t specify a timezone. Caching issues can mean the user may not be experiencing the version that’s officially been deployed, and canary deployments mean you could have multiple versions live at the same time and no way to know which the user is seeing. Explicit versioning is also useful during development and testing, allowing developers, testers, project managers and operations to see what version is available in which environment in real time so that issue can be better reported, more easily reproduced and tested, and more swiftly resolved. Giving operational staff a way to check what version is live is also a quick and easy smoke test after any deployment. One way to acheive this is to include the below script as an early part of your build process. It produces a json file which can easily be imported/read/compiled during the build, and the data used to display the version at runtime. You can use the build information to display a version on the login screen and/or subtley in the footer. If you choose to only display some of the information, you can make the rest available as a tool-tip or via console.log. Or if you’re building an API you can expose a GET /version endpoint that returns the json as-is. #! /bin/sh set -eu # This file should be saved as scripts/build-info.sh or similar, and # run early in the build process to allow other code to import/read/link # the generated file and make the information available to the end user. # If the version you are building is tagged the tag will be used, # like \"v1.4.3\" # If the version you are building is not tagged the previous tag will # be used and the number of commits since the last tag and the hash of # the current commit will be appended, like \"v1.4.3-20-g1a5ef12\" # If you have uncommitted changes, such as during development, \"dirty\" # will be appended like \"v1.4.3-dirty\" # If you have not yet created any tags you will get the error # \"fatal: No names found, cannot describe anything\". If needed you can # tag your root commit v0.0.0 version=$(git describe --dirty --tags) # This is an ISO-8601 timestamp which can be easily interpreted by # humans and most computer systems. The format is given explicity here # to be compatible with mac and linux when=$(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z) # The name of the current user account. It can be useful to know if # the build was created manually/locally or by an automated system. who=${USER} # You should add build-info.json to your .gitignore cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; build-info.json { \"version\": \"$version\", \"when\": \"$when\", \"who\": \"$who\" } EOF . Recording versions elsewhere such as package.json can be useful if you’re distributing a library for example, but the above script provides continous, automatic and specific version information during development and for systems which are continously deployed. An example react component: . import buildInfo from '../build-info.json' export const Footer = () =&gt; { return ( &lt;span&gt; Copyright {new Date().toLocaleDateString(undefined, { year: 'numeric'})} &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style={{ textAlign: 'right' }} title={JSON.stringify(buildInfo, null, 2)}&gt; {buildInfo.version} &lt;/span&gt; ) } . An example express route: . const express = require('express') const buildInfo = require('../build-info.json') const app = express() app.get('/build-info', function (req, res) { res.send(JSON.stringify(buildInfo, null, 2)) }) .

    "content": "First we need grab ourselves an OS image. While that’s downloading, we can list the attached drives before and after inserting our SD card, to find it’s device name. &gt; lsblk -p NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT /dev/mmcblk0 179:0 0 14.9G 0 disk └─/dev/mmcblk0p1 179:1 0 14.9G 0 part /media/aaron/9016-4EF8 . Once the image is downloaded, we can decompress it and write it to the SD card. unzip ~/Downloads/2022-01-28-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.zip sudo dd if=./2022-01-28-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.img \\ of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4M conv=fsync status=progress . This might take a minute or two. -p pipes the contents to stdout rather than disk, and fsync ensure dd flushes writes to the SD card on completion.

My OS has handily mounted this for me, you may have to do that manually. &gt; cd /media/aaron &gt; ls boot rootfs . To enable ssh on boot we can create the below empty file. &gt; touch boot/ssh . And configure the WiFi connection. &gt; vim boot/wpa_supplicant.conf ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev country=&lt;Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here&gt; update_config=1 network={ ssid=\"&lt;Name of your wireless LAN&gt;\" psk=\"&lt;Password for your wireless LAN&gt;\" } . Note that you are writing your WiFi password in plaintext on an unencrypted filesystem, so don’t leave this pi anywhere bad actors might have physical access. If you want to add multiple networks add id_str with a unique name like . ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev country=&lt;Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here&gt; update_config=1 network={ ssid=\"&lt;Name of your wireless LAN&gt;\" psk=\"&lt;Password for your wireless LAN&gt;\" id_str=\"Home_2.4GHz\" } network={ ssid=\"&lt;Name of your wireless LAN&gt;\" psk=\"&lt;Password for your wireless LAN&gt;\" id_str=\"Home_5GHz\" } . We want our pi to have a predictable IP. This can be done though DHCP reservation if your router supports it, but raspberry pis have a habit of randomising their MAC address which makes that tricky. A more reliable solution is to assign a static IP address on the pi itself. Check your router settings to ensure you pick an IP address that won’t be assigned to another device via DHCP. Pick a hostname and IP address. You can get inspiration from any ordered set, chemical elements, roman emporors, I usualy use pokemon. This device will be named zenigame and have IP address 192.168.1.7 . Open rootfs/etc/dhcpcd.conf and append to the end the following lines. Your router address may vary, try sudo arp-scan --localnet if you’re not sure. static ip_address=192.168.1.7/24 static routers=192.168.1.254 static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.254 . Note that this sets the same IP address for both the WiFi and ethernet interfaces, so you may not be able to use both at once. To set the hostname, edit rootfs/etc/hostname and rootfs/etc/hosts and change the default raspberrypi to your chosen name, I’m using zenigame. I also like to customise rootfs/etc/motd with some ascii art, I’m going to be using this by Maija Haavisto. This is about as far as we can get with the pi offline, so let’s unmount the SD card and power up our pi. &gt; sudo umount boot &gt; sudo umount rootfs . ",

    "content": "For a given exponential curve and a given line, can we know if and where they intersect? . That is, for two equations \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) \\[ y = mx + b \\] \\[ z = e^{nx} + c\\] can we solve \\(y = z\\), or even tell if there is a solution? \\[ mx + b = e^{nx} + c \\] . A better mathmatician than I might be able to solve that, but in the meantime let's graph an example. Below \\(y\\) intersects \\(z\\), but not \\(z'\\). Looking at this graph we can see that the exponential gradient starts shallow and ends up steep. And if the curves intersect, it must be at points where there gradients are unequal, else they'd be parralel. Assuming both curves have a positive gradient, at the first intersection the gradient of \\(z\\) must be less than that of \\(y\\), and vice versa at the second intersection. And as both curves are smooth, somewhere in between these intersections the gradients must be equal. Differentiating these functions we get \\[ {dy \\over dx} = m \\] \\[ {dz \\over dx} = ne^{nx}\\] and when equated we can easily solve for \\(x\\) \\[ ne^{nx} = m \\] \\[ e^{nx} = { m \\over n } \\] \\[ nx = \\ln { m \\over n } \\] \\[ nx = \\ln m - \\ln n \\] \\[ x = { \\ln m - \\ln n \\over n } \\] . So now we know that when \\( x = { \\ln m - \\ln n \\over n } \\) the lines are parallel, and if the lines intersect at all \\(z\\) must be less than \\(y\\) at this point. Once we know there the lines intersect, we can resort to numerical methods to find the intersection itself, such as a binary search or the Newton-Raphson method. ",

By the time you’ve saved up your deposit, it may no longer be enough to afford the house you want! . Just by glancing at the graph above we can see that house prices go up over the long term, but predicting even a few years ahead is difficult. Trends plotted in 1990 or 2007 would not have been accurate a few years later. Many finance trends are exponential, so let’s look at the above data on a logarithmic scale. Now the same data paints a different picture, if fact in you squint hard enough you can almost see a linear trend. Smoother data is easier to predict, and the 2008 financial crash does look a lot less pronounced from this perspective, appearing to be merely a reversion to the “expected” price. However the 1990s slump is still there, and new irregularities have even appeared, such as the boom in the early 1970s. An easing of credit conditions by the Bank of England coupled with the go-for-growth strategy of the Conservative chancellor, Tony Barber, resulted in house-price inflation peaking at 36%. The average price of a home, which had risen from £2,000 to £5,000 between 1950 and 1970, doubled in the next three years. The boom ended when the Yom Kippur war and the Opec oil embargo ushered in the stagflation of the mid-1970s. L. Elliot, A brief history of British housing .
